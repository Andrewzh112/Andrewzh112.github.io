This template is tuned for research notes and narrative explanations. It is
opinionated in layout, but flexible in content. You can write the story in MDX
and drop in interactive components wherever they add insight.

<SideNote title="Workflow">
  Draft in MDX, keep citations in `src/bib/references.bib`, and add interactive
  figures as React components.
</SideNote>

## A narrative-first layout

The flow is designed for long-form reading with calm typography and careful
spacing. Inline math like $E = mc^2$ is rendered with MathJax. Display math is
supported as well:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \log \hat{y}_i
$$

Citations are written in Pandoc style [@doe2020; @smith2019].

## Interactive figure

<InteractiveFigure title="Wave response" client:visible />

## Wide figures and annotations

<Figure
  src="/figures/overview.svg"
  alt="A schematic view of an experiment"
  caption="A wide figure that bleeds past the text column."
  wide
/>

<SideNote title="Tip">
  Use margin notes for definitions or quick asides. They float to the right on
  wider screens.
